A Fast and accurate Robotic Grasp Method Using Deep Learning:

The code for the whole system can be divided into:
1. Data set annotation code(used to create your own data set)
2. Driver for Robotic Arm.
3. Gazebo Model
4. Code for object detection and real world robotic arm grasping

Citation: The main code are modified based on Faster R-CNN developed by Shaoqing Ren et al.:

    Title = {{Faster R-CNN}: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks},

Requirements: software

1. Caffe build for Faster R-CNN (included in this repository, see external/caffe)
	If you are using Windows, you may download a compiled mex file by running 	  fetch_data/fetch_caffe_mex_windows_vs2013_cuda65.m
	If you are using Linux or you want to compile for Windows, please follow the 		instructions on our Caffe branch.
2. MATLAB 2015b or higher version
3. ROS indigo version
4. Gazebo 2.2.5 or higher
5. Openni_for_ROS package

Requirements: Hardware
GPU: Titan, Titan Black, Titan X, K20, K40, K80.

1. Region Proposal Network (RPN)
	2GB GPU memory for ZF net
	5GB GPU memory for VGG-16 net
2. Object Detection Network (Fast R-CNN)
	3GB GPU memory for ZF net
	8GB GPU memory for VGG-16 net

Preparation for code Testing:
1. Run fetch_data/fetch_caffe_mex_windows_vs2013_cuda65.m to download a compiled Caffe mex (for Windows only).
2. Run faster_rcnn_build.m
3. Run startup.m
4. Download "Pre-Train_model" and "VOCdevkit2007" folder from kronos I uploaded.
5. Put "Pre-Train-model" under "Grasping/experiments/models", and put "VOCdevkit2007" under "Grasping/experiments/datasets".
6. Create ROS packages for robotic arm code folder "Arm Init" and use cmake to compile.
7. Open Terminal and switch to the arm package folder type:source devel/setup.bash
8. make sure the arm is plugged into the computer and powered on, type "roslaunch controller controller_manager.launch" in terminal
9. Open another Terminal and repeat step 5, then type:"roslaunch controller start_tilt_controller.launch"
10. Plugin Kinect and open a new Terminal and type:" roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
11. Run script_faster_rcnn_VOC2007_ZF.m using matlab under directory:"Grasping/experiments/" to train the model. Or download "faster_rcnn_final" and put it under Grasping/experiments/output".
12. Run GraspAll.m.
